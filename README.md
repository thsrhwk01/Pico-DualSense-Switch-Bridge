# Pico DualSense Switch Bridge

[한국어](./README.KR.md) | [简体中文](./README.CN.md)

> Use a Raspberry Pi Pico 2 W to bridge a Bluetooth DualSense or DualSense Edge
> controller to either a wired DualSense USB device for PC or a wired Nintendo
> Switch Pro Controller USB device for Nintendo Switch 2.

This project is a fork of [awalol/DS5Dongle](https://github.com/awalol/DS5Dongle).
It preserves the original PC DualSense bridge and adds a runtime-selectable,
Switch 2-compatible Nintendo Switch Pro Controller profile. See
[Credits and license](#credits-and-license) for the upstream and protocol sources.

## Overview

Version 0.8.2 fixes an audio initialization heap shortage in v0.8.1 that
could leave the device unresponsive, with Windows USB recognition errors and
BOOTSEL actions failing. It retains the upstream `v0.7.2-hotfix` PC audio/haptics
baseline and Switch mode. Firmware source is unchanged from v0.8.2-rc.1.

Upgrading from v0.8.1 preserves the existing settings format and pairing data.
Upgrading from v0.8.0 resets firmware settings to schema v5 defaults; reselect
Switch mode with BOOTSEL if needed. Known issue: speaker volume may be very low
on the first controller connection after PC startup; disconnecting and
reconnecting the controller restores it in the reported case. This release
does not fix that volume issue.

The controller stays paired with the Pico over Bluetooth. The Pico exposes one USB
profile at a time and remembers the selected profile across power cycles.

| USB profile | Intended host | USB identity | Key capabilities |
|---|---|---|---|
| DualSense | Windows / PC | DualSense or DualSense Edge | Native inputs, touchpad, motion, adaptive triggers, haptics, speaker, headset and microphone |
| Switch Pro | Nintendo Switch 2 | Nintendo Switch Pro Controller (`057E:2009`) | Buttons, sticks, digital ZL/ZR, Home, Capture; gyro/motion and HD Rumble are in development |

The Switch profile uses the original Nintendo Switch Pro Controller protocol, not the
new Switch 2 Pro Controller protocol. Switch 2 therefore requires **Nintendo Switch Pro
Controller Wired Communication** to be enabled in console settings. Switch input uses
the original Pro Controller's 8 ms USB interval (125 Hz). NFC/amiibo and the Switch 2
`C` button are not supported.

## Features

## Getting Started

### Get the firmware

You have two options:

- **Download a pre-built `.uf2`** — grab the newest
  [Releases](../../releases) build (`pico-dualsense-switch-bridge-<version>.uf2`; other board
  builds are bundled in `other.board.zip`; `config_tool.py` is attached there
  too). No tools needed.
- **Build it yourself** — see [Build Instructions](#build-instructions)
  below (Windows users get a one-command script).

### Flashing Firmware

1. Hold the BOOTSEL button on the Pico2W
2. Connect the Pico2W to your computer via USB
3. The device will mount as a USB storage device
4. Drag and drop the .uf2 firmware file onto the device

> The firmware also supports a **reboot-to-BOOTSEL** command: the **Reboot to Bootloader** button in the
> [web config](#configuration) reboots the dongle into BOOTSEL mode without holding the physical button.

### Pairing the Controller

1. Put the DualSense controller into Bluetooth pairing mode
2. Wait for the Pico2W to detect and connect
3. Once connected, the device will appear on the host system

***You may need to replug the Pico when the controller is in pairing mode.***

### USB output modes

The default profile is **DualSense** for Windows. While the firmware is running,
double-click BOOTSEL to switch to **Nintendo Switch Pro Controller** output; double-click
again to return to DualSense. The selected profile is saved in flash and restored on
the next boot. USB disconnects and reconnects automatically when the profile changes.
The DualSense remains paired with the Pico, so changing USB profiles does not require
Bluetooth pairing again.

Do not hold BOOTSEL while plugging the Pico in to select a profile: the RP2350 boot ROM
uses that gesture for UF2 flashing, so the application firmware does not run. Profile
selection is deliberately a runtime double click.

For Switch 2, open **System Settings → Controllers & Accessories** and enable
**Nintendo Switch Pro Controller Wired Communication**. Switch to the Pro profile,
then physically reconnect the Pico to the dock for the first test. DualSense mode is
not natively recognized by Switch 2.

**Switch gyro/motion is still in development and has known bugs.** The current
implementation converts DualSense motion samples into the Switch report format,
but correct motion behavior is not yet assured.

**Switch HD Rumble is experimental and still in development.** The current
implementation decodes the rumble data and synthesizes stereo PCM for the DualSense
actuators. The vibration may feel similar, but its accuracy and completeness are
still being evaluated; it should not be treated as a completed or faithful HD Rumble
implementation. A 500 ms watchdog ramps the actuators to silence if the USB host
disappears while rumble is active.

### BOOTSEL button: pair, change USB mode, or clear controllers

While the firmware is running, the Pico's **BOOTSEL button** doubles as a
controller and USB-profile control — no unplugging or re-flashing needed:

- **Short press (click):**
  - If a controller is connected, the current one is disconnected (its pairing is
    kept, so it can reconnect later). Use this to free the dongle for a different
    already-paired controller.
  - If nothing is connected, a 30-second scan starts to pair a new controller.
    Put the DualSense into pairing mode (hold **PS + Create/Share** until the
    light bar flashes) while the scan runs.
- **Double click:** switch between **DualSense** and **Switch Pro** USB output,
  persist the selection, and reconnect USB. (Clicks register after a brief pause,
  to allow for a second/third click.)
- **Triple click:** **Reboot into BOOTSEL** — the dongle re-enumerates as a USB
  mass-storage drive so you can drag on a new `.uf2`, without holding BOOTSEL while
  plugging in.
- **Long press (~1.5 s):** Disconnect and **forget every paired controller** — all
  stored pairings are deleted and blacklisted so they won't silently auto-reconnect,
  even across a power cycle. The onboard LED flashes six times to confirm. To use a
  forgotten controller again, put it back into **PS + Create/Share** pairing mode.

> Triple click is a software path into the bootloader; you can also still enter it
> the hardware way by holding BOOTSEL **while plugging in** the Pico (see
> [Flashing Firmware](#flashing-firmware) above). All of these act on
> click / double / triple / long-press **while the firmware is already running**.

## Configuration

You can modify the Pico settings via the upstream-compatible web config.

### [zurce/DS5Dongle-OLED](https://github.com/zurce/DS5Dongle-OLED)

## Notes

The Pico device will only be visible to the system after the controller is connected

Some behaviors depend on reconnection cycles to take effect

### Microphone

The controller microphone is exposed as a USB audio input — "Headset Microphone"
on Windows. After selecting it as your recording device, raise its input/capture
level in your OS: Windows in particular often defaults it to 0 (or very low),
which makes the mic seem dead even though it is working.

### Low-battery LED indicator

When the connected DualSense reports its battery at or below 10% (and it is not charging), the Pico onboard LED switches
from solid-on to a 1 Hz blink so you can see the warning at a glance. The LED returns to solid-on as soon as the
controller is plugged in or its reported level rises again. The blink also fires when `disable_pico_led` is set — the
warning is treated as critical and overrides the LED-off preference; the LED returns to its disabled (off) state once
the battery recovers or the controller starts charging.

To opt out at build time, configure with `-DENABLE_BATT_LED=OFF`. Default is ON.

### Pico W Version

Pico W only has haptics support, no speaker. You can enable Pico W firmware compilation with `-DPICO_W_BUILD=ON`, or
download precompiled firmware from GitHub Actions.

### Waveshare RP2350B-Plus-W

The [Waveshare RP2350B-Plus-W](https://www.waveshare.com/wiki/RP2350B-Plus-W) is an RP2350B-based board with the RM2 wireless module (same CYW43 silicon as the Pico 2 W), 16 MB QSPI flash, and a USB-C connector. Build with:

```
cmake -S . -B build -G Ninja -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release \
      -DPICO_SDK_PATH=<sdk> -DWAVESHARE_RP2350B_PLUS_W_BUILD=ON
cmake --build build --target pico-dualsense-switch-bridge
```

Or download precompiled firmware from GitHub Actions.

### USB Wake Feature

Wake-on-PS is now built into the standard firmware — there is no separate `feat/usb-wake` branch or `pico-dualsense-switch-bridge-wake.uf2`
build. It is **disabled by default**; turn it on with the **Wake PC from sleep on PS button** toggle in the
[web config](#configuration). When enabled, the dongle presents a HID keyboard interface and advertises USB remote
wakeup so a controller button can wake the PC; when disabled, that interface is not enumerated. See
[Wake-on-PS](#wake-on-ps-optional) for setup.

It is recommended to read #60 and #61 before using this feature.

## Known Issues

- ⚠️ Audio may experience slight stuttering

## Performance

The audio path — libopus encode/decode, the resampler, and the Bluetooth/USB
packet handling on the hot path — executes from **RAM** instead of flash. This
removes flash-fetch (XIP cache miss) stalls from the time-critical audio loop,
which previously forced the RP2350 to be overclocked just to keep up with audio
encoding.

As a result, the firmware runs the **full audio path (haptics, speaker, 3.5 mm
output, and microphone) at the stock 150 MHz clock — no overclock and no
core-voltage bump.**

> Earlier releases required 320 MHz @ 1.2 V; overclocking is no longer needed.
> If you build for a different board and it fails to boot, reduce the CPU
> frequency (and/or raise the voltage) in `CMakeLists.txt`.

## Build Instructions

### Windows 11 (one command, no WSL)

You don't even need to clone this repo. Download just
[`tools/build-windows.ps1`](tools/build-windows.ps1) to any folder and run
it in **PowerShell**:

```powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\build-windows.ps1
```

(If you already have a checkout, run `tools\build-windows.ps1` from the
repo root instead — it detects and uses your local checkout.)

The script installs every prerequisite (CMake, Ninja, Python, Git and the
ARM GNU toolchain — via `winget`, falling back to portable downloads if
`winget` is unavailable), clones the project (if not run from a checkout)
plus the pinned Pico SDK + TinyUSB into
`%USERPROFILE%\.pico-dualsense-switch-bridge-build`, builds
the firmware, and drops `pico-dualsense-switch-bridge.uf2` next to the script and on your
Desktop. It is safe to re-run; already-installed tools are skipped.

Build a fork or a specific ref with `-Repo <url>` / `-Ref <branch|tag>`.

Build a variant with `-Variant debug`.

### Other platforms

To build from source manually:

Use CMake 3.18 or newer. Each firmware build checks the linked ELF for at least
128 KiB of initial heap (32 KiB with speaker processing disabled). This guards
against the Opus initialization allocation failure found in v0.8.1; it does not
replace hardware testing. Cold Opus analysis and SILK encoder quantization code
stays in flash to preserve RAM for the existing audio paths and buffers.

1. Install Pico SDK 2.2.0 and switch its TinyUSB submodule to TinyUSB 0.20.0,
   commit `3af1bec1a9161ee8dec29487831f7ac7ade9e189`.
2. Initialise this repo's submodules: `git submodule update --init --recursive`
3. Configure and build with the standard Pico SDK toolchain:
   `cmake -S . -B build -G Ninja -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DPICO_SDK_PATH=<sdk>`
   then `cmake --build build --target pico-dualsense-switch-bridge`

On macOS, `tools/build-macos.sh` can prepare a repo-local Pico SDK checkout, prompt to install missing Homebrew build
tools, initialize submodules, pin TinyUSB, and build the firmware:

```sh
tools/build-macos.sh
```

Use `tools/build-macos.sh --clean` to rebuild from scratch, or
`--sdk-dir <path>` to use an existing SDK checkout. When using `--sdk-dir`, the script asks before checking that SDK out
to the required Pico SDK and TinyUSB versions. If Homebrew's `arm-none-eabi-gcc` formula is installed without standard C
headers, the script asks to install the complete `gcc-arm-embedded` cask and points CMake at that toolchain.

## Xbox Game Bar (optional)

The **PS button = Xbox Game Bar** toggle in the [web config](#configuration) maps the controller's PS button to
keyboard shortcuts, sent over the same HID keyboard interface used by [Wake-on-PS](#wake-on-ps-optional):

- **Short press** (tap and release) → `Win`+`G`, which opens the **Xbox Game Bar** overlay.
- **Long press** (hold ≥ 750 ms) → `Win`+`Tab`, which opens **Task View**.

The toggle is off by default, and the keyboard interface is only enumerated while it (or wake) is enabled. 
> If the Game Bar overlay opens but does not respond to controller inputs, Windows may be missing the modern input stack. Installing or updating **Microsoft GameInput** will resolve this and restore controller navigation. You can install the service directly by opening an elevated command prompt and running `winget install Microsoft.GameInput`, or read the [official documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/gaming/gdk/docs/features/common/input/overviews/input-overview) for more details.

## Wake-on-PS (optional)

Enabling the **Wake PC from sleep on PS button** toggle in the [web config](#configuration) makes the dongle present a
second HID interface (a boot keyboard) and advertise USB remote wakeup. A controller button press while the host is
suspended then injects an **F15** keypress, waking the PC from **S3 sleep**. F15 was chosen because it has no default
Windows or app binding — a stray fire never inserts characters or triggers shortcuts. The toggle is off by default, and
the keyboard interface is only enumerated while it (or the Xbox Game Bar shortcut) is enabled.

Scope: **S3 only.** Modern Standby (S0ix) is not supported. To check your machine, run `powercfg /a` — you need
"Standby (S3)" listed under available sleep states.

After enabling the toggle (then **Reconnect USB** so the interface re-enumerates):

1. Open Device Manager → the new **HID Keyboard Device** (and its parent **USB Composite Device**) → Properties → Power
   Management → tick **"Allow this device to wake the computer."**
2. Verify with `powercfg /devicequery wake_armed`.
3. Sleep the PC; press any button on the controller; the PC should wake within ~1 s.
4. After a wake, `powercfg /lastwake` should attribute the wake to the HID Keyboard Device.

> Wake also needs `SelectiveSuspendEnabled = 1` (a `REG_DWORD`) on the controller's audio interface (`MI_00`). Windows
> only writes it at first install, so a runtime toggle may need it set manually. It lives under each per-instance
> `Device Parameters` key:
>
> ```
> HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Enum\USB\VID_054C&PID_0CE6&MI_00\<instance>\Device Parameters
>     SelectiveSuspendEnabled    (REG_DWORD) = 1
> ```
>
> `PID_0CE6` is the DualSense (`PID_0DF2` for the Edge), and `<instance>` is device/port-specific (e.g.
> `6&212078ea&1&0000`), so there can be more than one node — set it on every one. An elevated PowerShell one-liner that
> covers all present instances:
>
> ```powershell
> Get-ChildItem 'HKLM:\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Enum\USB\VID_054C&PID_0CE6&MI_00' | ForEach-Object {
>   New-ItemProperty "$($_.PSPath)\Device Parameters" SelectiveSuspendEnabled -Value 1 -PropertyType DWord -Force }
> ```
>
> Then Reconnect USB or reboot. (Re-installing the device — clearing its Windows device cache and replugging — also
> makes Windows write the value itself.)
